HASH FUNCTION DESCRIPTION







HASH TABLE IMPLEMENTATION







ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE OF YOUR ALGORITHM:
(order notation & concise paragraph, < 200 words)

L = length of the genome sequence
q - query length
p - number of different locations where key is found
k - key size (k-mer size)

How much memory will the hash table data structure require (order notation for memory use)?



What is the order notation for performance (running time) of each of
the commands? What about for the hash table's insert, find, and resize?



EXTRA CREDIT
Add a new command to implement the database using one of the other
 data structures that we have covered so far in the course: 
vectors, lists, arrays etc. 

Compare the performance your alternative method to the homework method
by making a table of run times for each of the genomes and query 
sets provided with the homework  and compare the times to build
the index and the times to process the queries. 
Document any new commands you have added in your README file.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:
