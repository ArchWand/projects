"Complete" means that the player sows the seeds from a hole and takes any additional turns required or completes a capture.Whenever the player gets an additional turn, you should display the board so someone looking at the screen can follow what's happening. If the move can be completed, return true; if not, because the move is not yet completed but side s has no holes with beans to pick up and sow, sweep any beans in s's opponent's holes into that opponent's pot and return false.
		void play();
		//Play the game.Display the progress of the game in a manner of your choosing, provided that someone looking at the screen can follow what's happening. If neither player is interactive, then to keep the display from quickly scrolling through the whole game, it would be reasonable periodically to prompt the viewer to press ENTER to continue and not proceed until ENTER is pressed. (The ignore function for input streams is useful here.) Announce the winner at the end of the game. You can apportion to your liking the responsibility for displaying the board between this function and the move function.
		int beans(Side s, int hole) const;
		//Return the number of beans in the indicated hole or pot of the game's board, or −1 if the hole number is invalid. This function exists so that we and you can more easily test your program.
